            - Prompt Aura explanation

               - please write an well-structured concise and brief explanation for the aura as the following format: 

                  - case 1: if mapping is practical, English words and Chinese characters should be mapped according to connotation precisely:

                     + # Flightily Treacherous (輕狂詭詐的)

                         輕浮 狂放 詭異 狡詐

                        - **Flightily (輕狂)**:

                           - **輕狂** refers to someone who is impulsive, unpredictable, and carelessly reckless, often without much thought to consequences. It combines elements of flippancy with a wild, unpredictable nature.

                           - **Flightily** captures this sense of unpredictability and impulsiveness, conveying a person who is erratic and unreliable, often driven by whims.

                        - **Treacherous (詭詐)**:

                           - **詭詐** refers to cunning, deceitful behavior with a sinister and manipulative edge. It implies trickery and betrayal, often veiled behind a facade of trust.

                           - **Treacherous** encapsulates the sly and deceitful nature of **詭詐**, emphasizing the active betrayal and malicious intent behind the actions, with a calculated approach to harm or deceive others.

                  - case 2: If mapping is difficult, give up mapping and use the following format:

                     + # Fiercely Upright (赤誠凜然的)

                        **熱情誠摯 態度正直 人格嚴正**

                        - **Fiercely**:

                           - **Fiercely** reflects a strong and intense dedication, suggesting a passionate, bold, and determined nature. It conveys unrelenting energy and conviction, especially in upholding principles or pursuing goals.

                        - **Upright**:

                           - **Upright** denotes moral integrity, ethical steadfastness, and a principled approach to life. It suggests an individual who is honorable, righteous, and disciplined.

                        - **赤誠** (Sincere Passion):

                           - **赤誠** describes a heartfelt and sincere enthusiasm, characterized by genuineness, honesty, and emotional warmth. It emphasizes a commitment to authenticity and a strong moral foundation.

                        - **凜然** (Dignified Integrity):

                           - **凜然** conveys an aura of solemn dignity and unyielding moral strength. It often carries an air of authority and commands respect, reflecting a person who stands firm in their convictions with an imposing presence.

               - the English words and Chinese characters should be mapped according to connotation precisely.

               - Don’t propose new word to replace old one, if mapping is impossible, let’s explain English words and Chinese characters respectively, while align with the envisioned format and structure.

🔁 轉換: [\[Seed Components\]\]

      Let's delve into story/module seed further. A seed is composed of ideas and requirements. Requirements can be classify to soft and hard. Hard(necessary) requirements are to make whole system(story) logical, usually derived from other modules dependencies or seeds. Soft(optional) requirement are goals and effects the developer(writer) want the module to achieve, usually derived from developer's preference. Ideas can be anything, such as developer's inspiration, the modules from other story. Ideas are optional components which can help writer complete the story template.

      #### \[\[Seed Refinement\]\]

      When ideas of story seed contain many temporary modules, it is time to distill writer's true desire from those modules, and distribute those desire to soft requirements of story seed.

      #### DDD (X)

      In software engineering, Domain Driven Design can help engineer develop a software architectue with high cohering and low coupling. Some story parameters (such as characters, plots and settings) can be seen as member modules of a story, and some modules may depend on other modules, forming a high coupling dependency relationship. Once we modify a module, its dependent modules may also need to make some modification to let the story make sense. Can we leverage the philosophy of DDD to design a Story Architecture which has low module coupling? Or, can we design a module configuration priority or workflow  to reduce modification of dependent modules?
